# Computer Graphics Scene
--- 
Scene.cpp compiled along with Eck's camera APi to render a movable 3D scene of the room of a student in 2020 when covid kept everyone at home. It uses various simple shapes to make up other redered objects in the scene. The surprise is that there is also some text rendered onto the screen. It
is located on the laptop screen and the best angle to view it from is from the left facing the right corner of the TV. In the zip file there should also be a screenshot of where the words are best seen on the laptop.
